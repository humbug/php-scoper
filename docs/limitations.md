### Dynamic symbols

PHP-Scoper tries to prefix strings as well whenever possible. There will however
be cases in which it will not be possible such as:

- strings in regexps, e.g. `/^Acme\\\\Foo/`
- concatenated strings, e.g.:
    - `$class = 'Symfony\\Component\\'.$name;`
    - `const X = 'Symfony\\Component' . '\\Yaml\\Ya_1';`


### Date symbols

You code may be using a convention for the date string formats which could be
mistaken for classes, e.g.:

```php
const ISO8601_BASIC = 'Ymd\THis\Z';
``` 

In this scenario, PHP-Scoper has no way to tell that string `'Ymd\THis\Z'` does
not refer to a symbol but is a date format. In this case, you will have to rely
on patchers. Note however that PHP-Scoper will be able to
handle some cases such as, see the [date-spec](../specs/misc/date.php).


### Heredoc values

If you consider the following code:

```php
<?php

<<<PHP_HEREDOC
<?php

use Acme\Foo;

PHP_HEREDOC;
```

The content of `PHP_HEREDOC` will not be prefixed. Some partial support could be
added in the future but is bound to be very limited due to the dynamic nature of
heredocs. If you consider the following for example:

```php
<?php

<<<EOF
<?php

{$namespaceLine}

// This file has been auto-generated by the Symfony Dependency Injection Component for internal use.

if (\\class_exists(\\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}::class, false)) {
    // no-op
} elseif (!include __DIR__.'/Container{$hash}/{$options['class']}.php') {
    touch(__DIR__.'/Container{$hash}.legacy');
    return;
}

if (!\\class_exists({$options['class']}::class, false)) {
    \\class_alias(\\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}::class, {$options['class']}::class, false);
}

return new \\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}(array(
    'container.build_hash' => '$hash',
    'container.build_id' => '$id',
    'container.build_time' => $time,
), __DIR__.\\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Container{$hash}');

EOF;
```

It would be very hard to properly scope the relevant classes.


### Callables

If you consider the two following values:

```php
['Acme\Foo', 'bar'];
'Acme\Foo::bar';
```

The classes used there will not be scoped. It should not be impossible to add
support for it, but it is currently not supported. See
[#286](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/286).


### String values

PHP-Scoper tries whenever possible to prefix strings as well:

```php
class_exists('Acme\Foo');

// Will be prefixed into:

\class_exists('Humbug\Acme\Foo');
```

PHP-Scoper uses a regex to determine if the string is a class name that must be
prefixed. But there is bound to have confusing cases. For example:

- If you have a plain string `'Acme\Foo'` which has nothing to do with a class,
  PHP-Parser will not be able to tell and will prefix it
- Classes belonging to the global scope: `'Foo'` or `'Acme_Foo'`, because there
  is no way to know if it is a class name or a random string except for a
  handful of methods such as `class_alias`, `function_exists`, etc.


### Native functions and constants shadowing

In the following example:

```php
<?php

namespace Foo;

is_array([]);

```

No use statement is used for the function `is_array`. This means that PHP will
try to load the function `\Foo\is_array` and if fails to do so will fallback
on `\is_array` (note that PHP does so only for functions and constants, not
classes).

In order to bring some performance optimisation, the call will nonetheless be
prefixed in `\is_array`. This *will* break your code if you were relying on
`\Foo\is_array` instead. This however should be _extremely_ rare, so if that
happens you have two solutions: use a [patcher](#patchers) or simpler remove
any ambiguity by making use of a use statement (which is unneeded outside of
the context of prefixing your code):

```php
<?php

namespace Foo;

use function Foo\is_array;

is_array([]);

```

The situation is exactly the same for constants.


### Composer Autoloader

PHP-Scoper does not support prefixing the dumped Composer autoloader and
autoloading files. This is why you have to manually dump the autoloader again
after prefixing an application.

Note: when using [Box][box], Box is able to take care of that step for you.

PHP-Scoper also can not handle Composers static file autoloaders. This is due
to Composer loading files based on a hash which is generated from package name
and relative file path. For a workaround see
[#298](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/298#issuecomment-525700081).


### Composer Plugins

Composer plugins are not supported. The issue is that for
[Exposing symbols][exposed-symbols] PHP-Scoper relies on the fact that you
should load the `vendor/scoper-autoload.php` file instead of
`vendor/autoload.php` to trigger the loading of the right classes with their
class aliases. However Composer does not do that and as a result interfaces such as
`Composer\Plugin\Capability\Capable` are prefixed but the alias is not registered.

This cannot be changed easily so for now when you are using an isolated version
of Composer, you will need to use the `--no-plugins` option.


### PSR-0 Partial support

As of now, given the following directory structure:

```
src/
  JsonMapper.php
  JsonMapper/
    Exception.php
```

with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
     "psr-0": {"JsonMapper": "src/"}
  }
}
```

The autoloading will not work. Indeed, PHP-Scoper attempts to support PSR-0 by
transforming it to PSR-4, i.e. in the case above:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
     "psr-4": {"PhpScoperPrefix\\JsonMapper": "src/"}
  }
}
```

If this will work for the classes under `src/JsonMapper/`, it will not for `JsonMapper.php`.
