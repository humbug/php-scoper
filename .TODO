Right now whitelisted class works as follow:

- They are prefixed but a class_alias statement is appended to their declaration with the old name
- Whitelisted class are dumped in a `scoper-autoload.php` autoloader which the users can use. This way, the class
  aliases will be triggered at that time

Right now the use statements of whitelisted class are not prefixed. IMO this should not matter and we could prefix
them still. This would reduce the need of custom code to treat them differently.

Prefix the return types of functions & methods; see func-declaration/global.php
Prefix functions if they are not internal
