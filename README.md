PHP-Scoper is a tool which essentially moves any body of code, including all
dependencies such as vendor directories, to a new and distinct namespace.


## Goal

PHP-Scoper's goal is to make sure that all code for a project lies in a 
distinct PHP namespace. This is necessary, for example, when building PHARs that:

* Bundle their own vendor dependencies; and
* Load/execute code from arbitrary PHP projects with similar dependencies

When a package (of possibly different versions) exists, and is found in both a PHAR
and the executed code, the one from the PHAR will be used. This means these
PHARs run the risk of raising conflicts between their bundled vendors and the
vendors of the project they are interacting with, leading to issues that are 
potentially very difficult to debug due to dissimilar or unsupported package versions.

## Installation


### Phive


You can install PHP-Scoper with [Phive][phive]

```bash
$ phive install humbug/php-scoper --force-accept-unsigned
```

To upgrade `php-scoper` use the following command:

```bash
$ phive update humbug/php-scoper --force-accept-unsigned
```


### PHAR

The preferred method of installation is to use the PHP-Scoper PHAR, which can
be downloaded from the most recent [Github Release][releases].


### Composer

You can install PHP-Scoper with Composer:

```bash
composer global require humbug/php-scoper
```

If you cannot install it because of a dependency conflict or you prefer to
install it for your project, we recommend you to take a look at
[bamarni/composer-bin-plugin][bamarni/composer-bin-plugin]. Example:

```bash
composer require --dev bamarni/composer-bin-plugin
composer bin php-scoper config minimum-stability dev
composer bin php-scoper config prefer-stable true 
composer bin php-scoper require --dev humbug/php-scoper
```

Keep in mind however that this library is not designed to be extended.


## Usage

```bash
php-scoper add-prefix
```

This will prefix all relevant namespaces in code found in the current working
directory. The prefixed files will be accessible in a `build` folder. You can
then use the prefixed code to build your PHAR.

**Warning**: After prefixing the files, if you are relying on Composer
for the autoloading, dumping the autoloader again is required.

For a more concrete example, you can take a look at PHP-Scoper's build
step in [Makefile](Makefile), especially if you are using Composer as
there are steps both before and after running PHP-Scoper to consider.

Refer to TBD for an in-depth look at scoping and building a PHAR taken from
PHP-Scoper's makefile.


## Configuration

If you need more granular configuration, you can create a `scoper.inc.php` by
running the command `php-scoper init`. A different file/location can be passed
with a `--config` option.

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

use Isolated\Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;

return [
    'output-dir' => null,                   // string|null
    'prefix' => null,                       // string|null
    'finders' => [],                        // Finder[]
    'patchers' => [],                       // callable[]
    'files-whitelist' => [],                // string[]
    'whitelist' => [],                      // string[]
    'whitelist-global-constants' => true,   // bool
    'whitelist-global-classes' => true,     // bool
    'whitelist-global-functions' => true,   // bool
];
```

### Output directory

The base output directory where the prefixed files will be generated. If `null` is given, "build" is used.
This setting will be overriden by the command line option of the same name if present. 


### Prefix

The prefix to be used to isolate the code. If `null` or `''` (empty string) is given,
then a random prefix will be automatically generated.


### Finders and paths

By default when running `php-scoper add-prefix`, it will prefix all relevant
code found in the current working directory. You can however define which
files should be scoped by using [Finders][symfony_finder] in the configuration:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

use Isolated\Symfony\Component\Finder\Finder;

return [
    'finders' => [
        Finder::create()->files()->in('src'),
        Finder::create()
            ->files()
            ->ignoreVCS(true)
            ->notName('/LICENSE|.*\\.md|.*\\.dist|Makefile|composer\\.json|composer\\.lock/')
            ->exclude([
                'doc',
                'test',
                'test_old',
                'tests',
                'Tests',
                'vendor-bin',
            ])
            ->in('vendor'),
        Finder::create()->append([
            'bin/php-scoper',
            'composer.json',
        ])
    ],
];
```

Besides the finder, you can also add any path via the command:

```
php-scoper add-prefix file1.php bin/file2.php
```

Paths added manually are appended to the paths found by the finders.


### Patchers

When scoping PHP files, there will be scenarios where some of the code being
scoped indirectly references the original namespace. These will include, for
example, strings or string manipulations. PHP-Scoper has limited support for
prefixing such strings, so you may need to define `patchers`, one or more
callables in a `scoper.inc.php` configuration file which can be used to replace
some of the code being scoped.

Here's a simple example:

* Class names in strings.

You can imagine instantiating a class from a variable which is based on a
known namespace, but also on a variable classname which is selected at
runtime. Perhaps code similar to:

```php
$type = 'Foo'; // determined at runtime
$class = 'Humbug\\Format\\Type\\' . $type;
```

If we scoped the `Humbug` namespace to `PhpScoperABC\Humbug`, then the above
snippet would fail as PHP-Scoper cannot interpret the above as being a namespaced
class. To complete the scoping successfully, a) the problem must
be located and b) the offending line replaced.

The patched code which would resolve this issue might be:

```php
$type = 'Foo'; // determined at runtime
$scopedPrefix = array_shift(explode('\\', __NAMESPACE__));
$class = $scopedPrefix . '\\Humbug\\Format\\Type\\' . $type;
```

This and similar issues *may* arise after scoping, and can be debugged by
running the scoped code and checking for issues. For this purpose, having a
couple of end to end tests to validate post-scoped code or PHARs is recommended.

Applying such a change can be achieved by defining a suitable patcher in
`scoper.inc.php`:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'patchers' => [
        function (string $filePath, string $prefix, string $content): string {
            //
            // PHP-Parser patch conditions for file targets
            //
            if ($filePath === '/path/to/offending/file') {
                return preg_replace(
                    "%\$class = 'Humbug\\\\Format\\\\Type\\\\' . \$type;%",
                    '$class = \'' . $prefix . '\\\\Humbug\\\\Format\\\\Type\\\\\' . $type;',
                    $content
                );
            }
            return $content;
        },
    ],
];
```


### Whitelisted files

For the files listed in `files-whitelist`, their content will be left
untouched during the scoping process.


### Whitelist

PHP-Scoper's goal is to make sure that all code for a project lies in a 
distinct PHP namespace. However, you may want to share a common API between
the bundled code of your PHAR and the consumer code. For example if you have
a PHPUnit PHAR with isolated code, you still want the PHAR to be able to
understand the `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` class.


### Constants & Classes & functions from the global namespace

By default, PHP-Scoper will prefix the user defined constants, classes and
functions belonging to the global namespace. You can however change that
setting for them to be prefixed as usual unless explicitly whitelisted:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'whitelist-global-constants' => false,
    'whitelist-global-classes' => false,
    'whitelist-global-functions' => false,
];
```


### Symbols

You can whitelist classes, interfaces, constants and functions like so like so:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'whitelist' => [
        'PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase',
        'PHPUNIT_VERSION',
        'iter\count',
        'Acme\Foo*', // Warning: will not whitelist sub namespaces like Acme\Foo\Bar but will whitelist symbols like
                     // Acme\Foo or Acme\Fooo
    ],
];
```

#### Caveats

This will _not_ work on traits and this alias mechanism is case insensitive, i.e.
when passing `'iter\count'`, if a class `Iter\Count` is found, this class will
also be whitelisted.


#### Implementation insights

##### Class whitelisting

The class aliasing mechanism is done like follows:
- Prefix the class or interface as usual
- Append a `class_alias()` statement at the end of the class/interface
  declaration to link the prefixed symbol to the non prefixed one
- Append a `class_exists()` statement right after the autoloader is
  registered to trigger the loading of the method which will ensure the
  `class_alias()` statement is executed

It is done this way to ensure prefixed and whitelisted classes can co-exist
together without breaking the autoloading. The `class_exists()` statements are
dumped in `vendor/scoper-autoload.php`, do not forget to include this file in
favour of `vendor/autoload.php`. This part is however sorted out by [Box][box]
if you are using it with the [`PhpScoper` compactor][php-scoper-integration]. 

So if you have the following file with a whitelisted class:

```php
<?php

namespace Acme;

class Foo {}
```

The scoped file will look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace Humbug\Acme;

class Foo {}

\class_alias('Humbug\\Acme\\Foo', 'Acme\\Foo', \false);
```

With:

```php
<?php

// scoper-autoload.php @generated by PhpScoper

$loader = require_once __DIR__.'/autoload.php';

class_alias('Humbug\\Acme\\Foo');   // Triggers the autoloading of
                                    // `Humbug\Acme\Foo` after the
                                    // Composer autoload is registered

return $loader;
```

##### Constants whitelisting

The constant aliasing mechanism is done by transforming the constant
declaration into a `define()` statement when this is not already the case.
Note that there is a difference here since `define()` defines a constant at
runtime whereas `const` defines it at compile time. You have a more details
post regarding the differences [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3193704/3902761)

Give the following file with a whitelisted constant:

```php
<?php

namespace Acme;

const FOO = 'X';
```

The scoped file will look like this:

```php
<?php

namespace Humbug\Acme;

\define('FOO', 'X');
```

##### Functions whitelisting

The function aliasing mechanism is done by declaring the original function
as an alias of the prefixed one in the `vendor/scoper-autoload.php` file.

Given the following file with a function declaration:

```php
<?php

// No namespace: this is the global namespace

if (!function_exists('dd')) {
    function dd() {}
}
```

The file will be scoped as usual in order to avoid any autoloading issue:

```php
<?php

namespace PhpScoperPrefix;

if (!function_exists('PhpScoperPrefix\dd')) {
    function dd() {...}
}
```

And the following function which will serve as an alias will be
declared in the `scoper-autoload.php` file:


```php
<?php

// scoper-autoload.php @generated by PhpScoper

$loader = require_once __DIR__.'/autoload.php';

if (!function_exists('dd')) {
    function dd() {
        return \PhpScoperPrefix\dd(...func_get_args());
    }
}

return $loader;
```


### Namespaces whitelisting

If you want to be more generic and whitelist a whole namespace, you can
do it so like this:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'whitelist' => [
        'PHPUnit\Framework\*',
    ],
];
```

Now anything under the `PHPUnit\Framework` namespace will not be prefixed.
Note this works as well for the global namespace:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'whitelist' => [
        '*',
    ],
];
```

Note that this may lead to autoloading issues. Indeed if you have the following package:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "PHPUnit\\": "src"
        }
    }
}
```

And whitelist the namespace `PHPUnit\Framework\*`, then the autoloading for this package
will be faulty and will not work. For this to work, the whole package `PHPUnit\*` would
need to be whitelisted.

**Warning:** the following _is not_ a namespace whitelist:

```php
<?php declare(strict_types=1);

// scoper.inc.php

return [
    'whitelist' => [
        'PHPUnit\F*',   // Will only whitelist symbols such as PHPUnit\F or PHPunit\Foo, but not symbols belonging to
                        // sub-namespaces like PHPunit\Foo\Bar
    ],
];
```


## Building a Scoped PHAR

### With Box

If you are using [Box][box] to build your PHAR, you can use the existing
[PHP-Scoper integration][php-scoper-integration]. Box will take care of
most of the things for you so you should only have to adjust the PHP-Scoper
configuration to your needs.


### Without Box

#### Step 1: Configure build location and prep vendors

Assuming you do not need any development dependencies, run:

```bash
composer install --no-dev --prefer-dist
```

This will allow you to save time in the scoping process by not
processing unnecessary files.


#### Step 2: Run PHP-Scoper

PHP-Scoper copies code to a new location during prefixing, leaving your original
code untouched. The default location is `./build`. You can change the default
location using the `--output-dir` option. By default, it also generates a random
prefix string. You can set a specific prefix string using the `--prefix` option.
If automating builds, you can set the `--force` option to overwrite any code
existing in the output directory without being asked to confirm.

Onto the basic command assuming default options from your project's root
directory:

```bash
bin/php-scoper add-prefix
```

As there are no path arguments, the current working directory will be scoped to
`./build` in its entirety. Of course, actual prefixing is limited to PHP files,
or PHP scripts. Other files are copied unchanged, though we also need to scope
certain Composer related files.

Speaking of scoping Composer related files... The next step is to dump the
Composer autoloader if we depend on it, so everything works as expected:

```bash
composer dump-autoload --working-dir build --classmap-authoritative
```


## Recommendations

There is 3 things to manage when dealing with isolated PHARs:

- The dependencies: which dependencies are you shipping? Fine controlled ones 
  managed with a `composer.lock` or you always ship your application with up 
  to date dependencies?
- The PHAR format: there is some incompatibilities such as `realpath()` which 
  will no longer work for the files within the PHAR since the paths are not 
  virtual.
- Isolating the code: due to the dynamic nature of PHP, isolating your 
  dependencies will never be a trivial task and as a result you should have
  some end-to-end test to ensure your isolated code is working properly. You 
  will also likely need to configure the [whitelists][whitelist] or 
  [patchers][patchers].

As a result, you _should_ have end-to-end tests for your (at the minimum) your 
released PHAR.

Since dealing with the 3 issues mentioned above at once can be tedious, it is
highly recommended to have several tests for each steps.

For example you can have a test for both your non-isolated PHAR and your 
isolated PHAR, this way you will know which step is causing an issue. If the 
isolated PHAR is not working, you can try to test the isolated code directly 
outside the PHAR to make sure the scoping process is not the issue.

To check if the isolated code is working correctly, you have a number of solutions:

- When using PHP-Scoper directly, by default PHP-Scoper dump the files in a 
  `build` directory. Do not forget that
  [you need to dump the Composer autoloader for the isolated code to work!](#step-2-run-php-scoper).
- When using [Box][box], you can use its `--debug` option from the `compile` 
  command in order to have the code shipped in the PHAR dumped in the `.box` 
  directory.
- When using a PHAR (created by [Box][box] or any other PHAR building tool), 
  you can use the [`Phar::extractTo()`][phar-extract-to] method.

Also take into consideration that bundling code in a PHAR is not guaranteed to work
out of the box either. Indeed there is a number of things such as 

For this reason, you should also h


## Limitations

### Dynamic symbols

PHP-Scoper tries to prefix strings as well whenever possible. There will however be cases in which it will not be
possible such as:

- strings in regexps, e.g. `/^Acme\\\\Foo/`
- concatenated strings strings, e.g.:
    - `$class = 'Symfony\\Component\\'.$name;`
    - `const X = 'Symfony\\Component' . '\\Yaml\\Ya_1';`


### Date symbols

You code may be using a convention for the date string formats which could be mistaken for classes, e.g.:

```php
const ISO8601_BASIC = 'Ymd\THis\Z';
``` 

In this scenario, PHP-Scoper has no way to tell that string `'Ymd\THis\Z'` does not refer to a symbol but is
a date format. In this case, you will have to rely on patchers. Note however that PHP-Scoper will be able to
handle some cases such as, see the [date-spec](specs/misc/date.php).


### Heredoc values

If you consider the following code:

```php
<?php

<<<PHP_HEREDOC
<?php

use Acme\Foo;

PHP_HEREDOC;
```

The content of `PHP_HEREDOC` will not be prefixed. Some partial support could be added in the future but is bound to
be very limited due to the dynamic nature of heredocs. If you consider the following for example:

```php
<?php

<<<EOF
<?php

{$namespaceLine}

// This file has been auto-generated by the Symfony Dependency Injection Component for internal use.

if (\\class_exists(\\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}::class, false)) {
    // no-op
} elseif (!include __DIR__.'/Container{$hash}/{$options['class']}.php') {
    touch(__DIR__.'/Container{$hash}.legacy');
    return;
}

if (!\\class_exists({$options['class']}::class, false)) {
    \\class_alias(\\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}::class, {$options['class']}::class, false);
}

return new \\Container{$hash}\\{$options['class']}(array(
    'container.build_hash' => '$hash',
    'container.build_id' => '$id',
    'container.build_time' => $time,
), __DIR__.\\DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR.'Container{$hash}');

EOF;
```

It would be very hard to properly scope the relevant classes.


### Callables

If you consider the two following values:

```php
['Acme\Foo', 'bar'];
'Acme\Foo::bar';
```

The classes used there will not be scoped. It should not be impossible to add
support for it but it is currently not supported. See 
[#286](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/286).


### String values

PHP-Scoper tries whenever possible to prefix strings as well:

```php
class_exists('Acme\Foo');

// Will be prefixed into:

\class_exists('Humbug\Acme\Foo');
```

PHP-Scoper uses a regex to determine if the string is a class name that must be
prefixed. But there is bound to have confusing cases. For example:

- If you have a plain string `'Acme\Foo'` which has nothing to do with a class,
  PHP-Parser will not be able to tell and will prefix it
- Classes belonging to the global scope: `'Foo'` or `'Acme_Foo'`, because there
  is no way to know if it is a class name or a random string except for a
  handful of methods:
  
- `class_alias()`
- `class_exists()`
- `define()`
- `defined()`
- `function_exists()`
- `interface_exists()`
- `is_a()`
- `is_subclass_of()`
- `trait_exists()`


### Native functions and constants shadowing

In the following example:

```php
<?php

namespace Foo;

is_array([]);

```

No use statement is used for the function `is_array`. This means that PHP will 
try to load the function `\Foo\is_array` and if fails to do so will fallback 
on `\is_array` (note that PHP does so only for functions and constants: not 
classes).

In order to bring some performance optimisation, the call will nonetheless be 
prefixed in `\is_array`. This *will* break your code if you were relying on 
`\Foo\is_array` instead. This however should be _extremely_ rare, so if that 
happens you have two solutions: use a [patcher](#patchers) or simpler remove 
any ambiguity by making use of a use statement (which is unneeded outside of 
the context of prefixing your code):

```php
<?php

namespace Foo;

use function Foo\is_array;

is_array([]);

```

The situation is exactly the same for constants.


### Grouped constants whitelisting

When a grouped constant declaration like the following is given:

```php
const X = 'foo', Y = 'bar';
```

PHP-Scoper will not be able to whitelist either `X` or `Y`. The statement
above should be replaced by multiple constant statements:

```php
const X = 'foo';
const Y = 'bar';
```


### Composer Autoloader

PHP-Scoper does not support prefixing the dumped Composer autoloader and 
autoloading files. This is why you have to manually dump the autoloader again 
after prefixing an application.

Note: when using Box, Box is able to take care of that step for you.

PHP-Scoper also can not handle Composers static file autoloaders. This is due
to Composer loading files based on a hash which is generated from package name
and relative file path. For a workaround see
[#298](https://github.com/humbug/php-scoper/issues/298#issuecomment-525700081).


### Composer Plugins

Composer plugins are not supported. The issue is that for 
[whitelisting symbols](#whitelist) PHP-Scoper relies on the fact that you 
should load the `vendor/scoper-autoload.php` file instead of 
`vendor/autoload.php` to trigger the loading of the right classes with their 
class aliases. However Composer does not do that and as a result interfaces such as
`Composer\Plugin\Capability\Capable` are prefixed but the alias is not registered. 

This cannot be changed easily so for now when you are using an isolated version
 of Composer, you will need to use the `--no-plugins` option.


### PSR-0 Partial support

As of now, given the following directory structure:

```
src/
  JsonMapper.php
  JsonMapper/
    Exception.php
```

with the following configuration:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
     "psr-0": {"JsonMapper": "src/"}
  }
}
```

The autoloading will not work. Indeed, PHP-Scoper attempts to support PSR-0 by
transforming it to PSR-4, i.e. in the case above:

```json
{
  "autoload": {
     "psr-4": {"PhpScoperPrefix\\JsonMapper": "src/"}
  }
}
```

If this will work for the classes under `src/JsonMapper/`, it will not for `JsonMapper.php`.

### WordPress

As of now PHP-Scoper does not easily allow to completely leave unchanged non-included third-party code causing some hurdles with Wordpress plugins. There is a standing issue about providing a better integration out of the box (See [#303][better-wp-support]) but alternatively you can already use [**WP React Starter**][wp-react-starter] which is a boilerplate for WordPress plugins.

If you are not able to migrate you can have a look at the solution itself, read more about it here [#303 (comment)][wp-react-starter-details].
